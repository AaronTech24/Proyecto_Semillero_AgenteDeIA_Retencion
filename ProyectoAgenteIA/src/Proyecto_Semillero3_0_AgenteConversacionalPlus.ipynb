The AI responds by acknowledging the financial situation and, to retain them, offers a 15% discount for 4 months or a 'Plan Ahorro' that could reduce costs by up to 20% long-term, asking which option the human prefers. Subsequently, the human reports a new, urgent issue: a red light on their Netlife modem, indicating no internet, stating they live in Ceibos and need to work immediately. The AI understands the urgency, explains the red light (LOS) signifies a fiber optic cut requiring a technical intervention, and has generated a priority technical visit order for the human's Ceibos address. The team will contact the human within 24 hours to coordinate the visit. As compensation for this inconvenience, the AI also offers a free additional speed bonus for one month once the service is restored and will keep the human informed about the visit status.\n",

            "\n",
            "Given the general nature of the client's complaint and the previous `ClasificadorDeRiesgo` output, I need to:\n",
            "1.  Acknowledge the client's frustration again.\n",
            "2.  Offer a specific technical solution from the `BusquedaDeSolucionesYBeneficios` output, or ask for more details to narrow down the problem. The provided solutions are quite specific (LOS light, speed issues, intermitency).

            "4.  The strategy also says: \"If the problem is technical, first offer the solution technical and then a small bonus of speed as a courtesy.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Since the client already said \"Ya reinicié y sigue igual\", the basic restart has been tried. The `BusquedaDeSolucionesYBeneficios` gave options like \"actualización de firmware remota o cambio de canal WiFi\" for intermitency, or \"test de velocidad\" for slowness. Without more specific information from the client, it's hard to pick the perfect first technical solution.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the `ClasificadorDeRiesgo` output already provided an empathetic response asking for more details (cédula/cuenta) to perform diagnostics. I should proceed with that. Let's assume I have the client's account details now to perform diagnostics.\n",
            "\n",
            "If I were to offer a technical solution based on the `BusquedaDeSolucionesYBeneficios` output without more info, it would be a guess. Given the high frustration, I should try to be more precise or escalate to a visit quickly if basic remote diagnostics are not possible or fail.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's re-evaluate. The `ClasificadorDeRiesgo` output *is* my initial response. It asks for account details to \"realizar diagnósticos más avanzados en línea y, si es necesario, coordinar una visita técnica\". This is a good first step after the initial empathy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assuming the client provides the account details, I would then use `BusquedaDeSolucionesYBeneficios` to guide my remote diagnostic steps. Since I don't have a new input from the client after my initial empathetic response, I need to simulate the next step.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's assume the client has provided their account details and I've run some remote diagnostics. The `BusquedaDeSolucionesYBeneficios` output provides general solutions. Given the client's \"siempre pasa lo mismo\", it suggests a recurring or complex issue that might not be solved by simple remote fixes.\n",
            "\n",
            "The strategy states: \"If the solution technical fails, use 'AgendarVisita'.\" Since the client already tried restarting and is highly frustrated, and the problem is persistent, a remote solution might not be sufficient or might have already been tried by the client in the past.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the high risk and persistent nature of the problem, and the client's frustration, directly offering a more robust solution like a technical visit might be more effective than trying another remote troubleshooting step that might fail again and increase frustration.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's consider the flow:\n",
            "1.  Client expresses frustration (done).\n",
            "2.  `ClasificadorDeRiesgo` identifies high risk (done).\n",
            "3.  My empathetic response asks for account details for advanced diagnostics or a visit (simulated).\n",
            "4.  Now, I need to *act* on the technical problem. The `BusquedaDeSolucionesYBeneficios` gives options, but none are a guaranteed fix without more info. The client's \"siempre pasa lo mismo\" implies that basic troubleshooting might have failed before.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, to address the high risk and persistent nature, and to show a strong commitment to resolution, scheduling a visit seems like a more proactive and effective next step, especially since the client has already tried a basic fix. This aligns with \"If the solution technical fails, use 'AgendarVisita'.\" The client's restart failed, which counts as a basic technical solution attempt.\n",
