La queja es directa y el tono es de exasperación.\\n\\n**Análisis de Léxico:**\\n*   **\"Lentísimo\"**: Es un superlativo absoluto que denota un grado extremo de lentitud. No es solo \"lento\", sino \"extremadamente lento\". Este término subraya la magnitud del problema percibido por el cliente y la alta frustración que le genera.\\n*   **\"la velocidad no es la que pago\"**: Esta frase es clave. No es una queja subjetiva sin base; el cliente está haciendo una comparación directa con el servicio contratado/prometido. Implica una percepción de incumplimiento contractual o de un servicio muy por debajo de las expectativas y el valor pagado. Sugiere que el cliente tiene un conocimiento claro de lo que debería recibir.\\n*   **\"quiero cancelar\"**: Esta es una declaración explícita de intención de deserción. No es una amenaza, una pregunta o una solicitud de ayuda, sino una decisión comunicada. Es el indicador más fuerte de una alta probabilidad de churn.\\n*   **Conclusión Léxica**: El lenguaje es directo, asertivo y no deja lugar a ambigüedades. El cliente ha pasado de la fase de queja a la fase de decisión de abandono.\\n\\n**Probabilidad de Deserción:**\\n*   **Alta**\\n\\n**Justificación de Probabilidad de Deserción:**\\nLa probabilidad de deserción es **Alta** debido a los siguientes factores:\\n1.  **Intención Explícita:** El cliente declara directamente \"quiero cancelar\", lo cual es el indicador más fuerte de churn inminente.\\n2.  **Problema Central del Servicio:** La queja se centra en la velocidad del internet, un pilar fundamental del servicio. La percepción de que \"no es la que pago\" agrava la situación, implicando un incumplimiento de valor.\\n3.  **Intensidad de la Queja:** El uso de \"lentísimo\" denota un alto nivel de frustración y una experiencia de usuario muy negativa.\\n4.  **Falta de Solicitud de Ayuda:** El cliente no pide soporte técnico ni una solución; directamente expresa su deseo de cancelar, lo que sugiere que ya ha agotado su paciencia o no confía en que se resuelva el problema.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'} id='lc_run--019bf7d0-ae29-7062-9f1a-8a46b04e9692-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 82, 'output_tokens': 1989, 'total_tokens': 2071, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1420}}\u001b[0m\n",

The `ClasificadorDeRiesgo` tool has been used and has confirmed a very high negative sentiment and a high probability of churn, noting that the customer is expressing a decision to cancel rather than seeking a solution. Given this analysis, the best response should acknowledge the customer's severe frustration and their explicit intent to terminate the service. I do not need to search for technical or commercial information at this point, as the customer is not asking for troubleshooting or details about cancellation, but rather stating their decision.
